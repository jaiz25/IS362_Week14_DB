    "Video streaming services like Hulu depend heavily on the video recommender system to help its users discover videos they would enjoy.  Existing recommendation systems compute the video relevance based on users' implicit feedback such as watch and search behaviors.  The system analyzes the user-to-video preference and computes the video-to-video relevance scores using traditional collaborative filtering based methods.  However, when a new video is added to the library, this kind of method performs poorly.  To solve this, one promising approach is exploiting video content for relevance prediction, for example, predicting the video relevance by analyzing the content of videos including image pixels, audios, subtitles and metadata.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a recommendation system is a common task that is faced by the likes of Hulu. The underlying goal of the recommendation system is to personalize content and identify relevant data for its users.  It could either be a collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.  Hybrid approaches also exists which combines both filtering and is increasing the efficiency of recommender systems."
